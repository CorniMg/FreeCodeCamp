     &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the late 18th century French occultists made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning, leading to the emergence of custom decks for use in divination via tarot card reading and cartomancy.[1] Thus, there are two distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used for card games and those used for divination. However, some older patterns, such as the Tarot de Marseille, originally intended for playing card games, are occasionally used for cartomancy.

  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like the common playing cards, tarot has four suits that vary by region: French suits are used in western, central and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe. Each suit has 14 cards: ten pip cards numbering from one (or Ace) to ten; and four face cards: King, Queen, Knight, and Jack/Knave/Page.   
    <code>Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit.[2] These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play conventional card games.</code>

  <header class="titlu">What do the different types of tarot cards mean?
    <p> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While each deck may vary in style, all have some commonalities. Every tarot deck consists of 78 cards. Twenty-two of those will be Major Arcana cards, which represent major life themes. “I would think about the Major Arcana cards as bigger events or bigger feelings.” says Wall. “They’re not always externally visible or only internal; sometimes it’s a combination of both. They are the big story beats in whatever is happening in your life.” The Major Arcana cards begin with 0, The Fool, and end with 21, The World. Here’s a quick breakdown of the Major Arcana with a few associations and keywords found online and in Finding the Fool:
      <code><span class="bold">The Major Arcana</span>

<section class="main-section" id="minor_arcana"><header class="titlu">Minor Arcana 
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The remaining 56 cards are called the Minor Arcana, which may provide a more day-to-day focus, rather than a lifelong arc. “The way I read the Minor Arcana, they go through really specific subthemes of those larger themes,” Francisco says. For Wall, these cards tend to represent more of the common or everyday experiences we go through — which doesn’t mean they’re not impactful. “We still can feel big things, even with minor or smaller cards. But they’ve got less changing-the-trajectory-of-your-life energy.” Minor Arcana cards are divided into four suits — wands, swords, pentacles, and cups — which correspond to the elements. Here’s a handy breakdown:</p>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="bold">Wands:</span> “Wands are symbolic of proactivity and action and are attributed to fire,” says Francisco. “It’s a very passionate suit,” says Knight. “So there’s a lot of determination happening, a lot of drive.”<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="bold">Swords:</span> Knight says the sword suit is a more intellectual suit, the suit of thought. “It might mean you’re in your head,” she explains. “I think of Nine of Swords, for example, which is the anxiety card — it’s us in our heads thinking of the worst-case scenario.” Francisco, too, says swords are of the mind: “Swords are a lot more focused on mental thought processes and are attributed to the element of air.” Gemini vibes!<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="bold">Pentacles:</span> “Pentacles,” says Francisco, “are traditionally more focused on earthly desires or earthly matters associated with the element of Earth.” In other words, this suit is all about what’s tangible, says Knight. “It’s the here and now, representing what is actually around me. My favorite card of this suit is the Eight of Pentacles, and that’s typically the worker card. What are we working toward? What are we trying to accomplish? Where do we need to be putting our attention and our effort? It’s more of a practical suit.”<br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="bold">Cups:</span> “When we think about cups, there’s usually liquid or water,” explains Knight. “When you think about water, especially from an astrology perspective, it typically represents our feelings. When you pull cups, you might be paying attention to the emotions that are associated with that archetype.” Francisco adds that Cups is “more feelings and emotions and heart-centered themes.”
    <code>“The cards are a mirror. They’re a reflection of you and your experience. That’s why they work for everybody — they’re shining back at us what we need to see or what we already know but maybe didn’t have the ability to grab right from our subconscious.” - Knight </code></p>

  <p><span class="bold">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Pick a space with the right vibes.</span><br>
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Whether you’re performing a reading for yourself or for someone else, it’s important to choose the right physical setting. Pick a comfortable space where you can sit with a table in front of you to lay out your cards. To set the scene, you could light a candle, lay out some crystals, or burn some incense to cleanse the space of any outside energies.[13] Once you’ve created the perfect vibes for your tarot reading, it’s time to get started!
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Pick a question to guide your reading.</span><br><br>
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Make sure to pick an open-ended question to ask the tarot.[14] Asking a question that’s too specific or narrow might not leave enough room for the tarot to provide a thorough answer. Open-ended questions allow the tarot room to provide in-depth insights into the situation and the energies surrounding it.
    <br>
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Once you’ve got your question in mind and you’ve shuffled your cards, it’s time to draw cards and arrange them in a spread. The decision of what spread to use is entirely up to you, but some spreads are better suited to answer certain types of questions.[17] For example, if you have a simple question, a Yes/No reading could be the right way to go. If you have a more complex question, like “Why do I feel unhappy in love,” a Past/Present/Future reading might be the best choice.
    There are scores of tarot spreads, but most of our experts recommend starting simply with a one-, two-, or three-card spread. Common three-card spreads include the “body, mind, spirit” spread and the “past, present, future” spread, in which the first card pulled represents the body or past, the second represents the mind or present, and the third represents the spirit or future. How those timelines are interpreted depends on the reading and the question being asked — for example, “future” might mean tomorrow or it might mean ten years from now. Wall particularly likes the less common “situation, challenge, advice” spread because it feels more practical and easier to interpret. “I tend to recommend spreads that feel a little more relatable,” they say. “I like when I can see what each position is relating to and have something I can walk away with.”
   <br> <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For two-card spreads, Louis likes to start with a “conscious, unconscious” spread. “The first card is ‘What am I conscious of in myself right now?’ and the second card ‘What am I unconscious of that I need to see with more clarity to help me move forward?’ It’s everything you need,” she says. Knight is also a big proponent of the two-card spread. “My favorite is ‘something to change, something to preserve’ because it’s giving the reader autonomy over the cards and their life,” she says. “It’s not predictive; it’s more reflective.” She also recommends an affirmation spread, in which the first card is “I can be _____” and the second continues with “even when ____.”
    
   <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Another common use of tarot is a daily card reading, in which a single card is pulled from the top of the shuffled deck and used as a reminder or guideline for the day ahead. For novices and seasoned readers alike, this is a great way to tap into intuition and become familiar with the cards. “I love a single-card reading,” says Wall. “It’s still one of my favorite ways to engage with the cards because there’s something really grounding and easy to connect with. What do I need to know today? Or what do I need to hear right now? Or what’s something I can do to take care of myself today?”
    
   <br> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Francisco also suggests the Celtic cross, a ten-card spread with six cards forming the shape of a cross and the remaining four along the right side. The Celtic cross encourages sitters to address a challenge by taking the past, present, and future into account. More nuanced than simpler spreads, the ten-card spread considers external factors, hopes and fears, the subconscious, and advice, and it draws the best possible outcome. While it may look daunting, he likes that each card’s placement has a specific meaning, making it a little easier to interpret. “It kind of did the work for me because each slot meant something for the card,” he says.
    
   <br><br> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;But Wall warns that this can be a lot for beginners, especially if you’re still familiarizing yourself with the cards. “Ten is so many cards to work with,” they say. “And if you’re still trying to figure out card meanings, or even if you’re a fairly confident reader, ten cards is a lot to wrangle and try to figure out the connections between them.” If you’re newer to tarot, it may be best to start with simpler spreads and work your way up.
    
   <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Louis teaches one called the archetypal tarot spread, which is based on the Celtic cross but rather than focusing on an outcome, it looks at where you are in the present. “I focus on higher calling and understanding shadow in that reading,” she says. “It brings it a little bit more into what’s happening inside of me and how I can decide to move forward in life, rather than ‘Where am I going, and what’s my destiny?’”
    
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;However many cards you’re using or whichever spread you try, make sure you stick with your plan, no matter what. Sometimes, readers may pull extra “clarifier” cards when the reading isn’t clear, but Wall says that almost always results in more confusion — you’re now trying to figure out how yet another card is related to the rest of the reading. Instead, take it slow and really pay close attention to each card you pull. “Every single card is there to reveal something about you that is already present,” says Louis. “Tarot is one of the best tools we have for cultivating a contemporary spirituality because it’s not dependent on rigid hierarchies and structures and dogmas. It is totally intuitive and interpretive, and it has everything to do with who you are and what your spiritual essence is — what you discover in yourself. That’s the microcosm connecting to the macrocosm.”

<section class="main-section" id="info"><header class="titlu">How do I learn more?
  <p>
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; If you’re looking to advance to the next level of tarot reading, there are a number of books you can buy and classes (online and off) you can take to sharpen your interpretation skills. Francisco has a podcast, Third Eye Sight. Jessica Dore, a popular tarot reader and author of Tarot for Change, periodically offers online courses. Little Red Tarot also offers an eight-week course on a sliding scale. Biddy Tarot has a wealth of resources, from free guides to certification programs. And there are many free lessons available on YouTube, like those by spiritual advisers Mystic Rainn and John Ballantrae, who has a very soothing accent.
  </p>
  <p> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Louis highly recommends the work of Mary Kay Greer, particularly her book Tarot for Yourself. Knight recommends it too, as well as Tarot for Life by Paul Quinn and Rachel Pollack and her own resources: a spread book called Tarot & Self-Discovery and her podcast, The Tarot Diagnosis. Louis also recommends Marie-Louise von Franz’s On Divination and Synchronicity, Rachel Pollack’s Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom, and Karen Hamaker-Zondag’s Tarot As a Way of Life, as well as her own course, the Archetypal Tarot School, which she says teaches people to use tarot for self-becoming. Wall recommends The Witch’s Book of Numbers by Rebecca Scolnick, WTF is Tarot? by Bakara Wintner, Tarot: No Questions Asked by Theresa Reed, and of course their own book, Finding the Fool.
    <code>"The thing about tarot - maybe this to me is the difference between it and working with a psychic - to me it's clarifying the things that you already know. I don't feel like any tarot reading I've done or received was particularly surprising. They always speak to things that you kind of felt already." - Liki Laine

<section class="main-section" id="tarotOfMarseilles"><header class="titlu">Tarot of Marseilles
  <p> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Tarot of Marseilles is a standard pattern of Italian-suited tarot pack with 78 cards that was very popular in France in the 17th and 18th centuries for playing tarot card games and is still produced today. It was probably created in Milan before spreading to much of France, Switzerland and Northern Italy. The name is sometimes spelt Tarot of Marseille, but the name recommended by the International Playing-Card Society is Tarot de Marseille, although it accepts the two English names as alternatives.[1] It was the pack which led to the occult use of tarot cards, although today dedicated decks are produced for this purpose.
</p>
  <p> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Research by Michael Dummett and others demonstrates that the Tarot pack was invented in northern Italy in the early 15th century and introduced into southern France when the French conquered Milan and the Piedmont in 1499. The antecedents of the Tarot de Marseille would then have been introduced into southern France at around that time. All Italian-suited tarot decks outside of Italy are descended from the Milan–Marseilles type with the exception of some early French and Belgian packs which show mixed influence from Tarocco Bolognese (see below).[2] The earliest surviving cards of the Marseilles pattern were produced by Philippe Vachier of Marseilles in 1639 and went up for sale in 2023, having recently been discovered by Thierry Depaulis.

<section class="main-section" id="rider-waiter"><header class="titlu">Rider–Waite Tarot
  <p>
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The Rider–Waite Tarot is a widely popular deck for tarot card reading,[1][2] first published by the Rider Company in 1909, based on the instructions of academic and mystic A. E. Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, both members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Also known as the Waite–Smith,[3] Rider–Waite–Smith,[4][5] or Rider Tarot,[4] the deck has been published in numerous editions and inspired a wide array of variants and imitations.[6][7] Estimates suggest over 100 million copies of the deck circulate across 20 countries.
  </p>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While the images are simple, the details and backgrounds feature abundant symbolism. Some imagery remains similar to that found in earlier decks, but overall the Waite–Smith card designs are substantially different from their predecessors. Christian imagery was removed from some cards, and added to others. For example, the "Papess" became the "High Priestess" and no longer features a Papal tiara, while the "Lovers" card, previously depicting a medieval scene of a clothed man and woman receiving a blessing from a noble or cleric was changed to a depiction of the naked Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the ace of cups featuring a dove carrying Sacramental bread. The Minor Arcana are illustrated with allegorical scenes by Smith, where earlier decks (with a few rare exceptions) had simple designs for the Minor Arcana.[9]

  Thoth Tarot
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thoth Tarot is an esoteric tarot deck painted by Lady Frieda Harris according to instructions from Aleister Crowley. Crowley referred to this deck as The Book of Thoth, and also wrote a 1944 book of that title intended for use with the deck.

  </p><p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Crowley originally intended the Thoth deck to be a six-month project aimed at updating the traditional pictorial symbolism of the tarot. However, due to increased scope, the project eventually spanned five years, between 1938 and 1943.
    The illustrations of the deck feature symbolism based upon Crowley's incorporation of imagery from many disparate disciplines, including science and philosophy and various occult systems (as described in detail in his The Book of Thoth).
